# Measuring system analysis (MSA)

## In brevi

This Jupyter notebook performs Wheeler's Evaluating the Measurement Process (EMP) analysis. My desire is that it will replace the Minitab macro.

## Data

Download the two data files:

- [control_chart_constants.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y3wviqWNa8sZe7gg4g3R-unDGEtKB7QO)

## Methodology

This Jupyter notebook uses Donald J. Wheeler's Evaluation the Measurement Process methodology.
